//! The layout cache: when the [`RenderTree`] is rebuilt, when it is spliced,
//! and what the viewport is anchored to.
//!
//! This file exists on its own because it holds a performance *contract*, and
//! a contract interleaved with keyboard handling is a contract nobody reads.
//! Three rules make it up.
//!
//! # 1. The build key must name every layout input
//!
//! [`App::ensure_layout`] rebuilds only when an input actually changed, so a
//! forgotten input means a stale tree on screen — the worst failure mode this
//! module has, because it is silent. Rather than maintain a second list of
//! fields by hand, [`BuildKey`] *is* the options: its `options` field is a
//! [`LayoutFingerprint`] derived structurally from the very [`LayoutOptions`]
//! the tree would be built from, so the correspondence holds by construction
//! and cannot drift when a field is added to the options. Only the two inputs
//! a fingerprint cannot see — the colour level, applied when drawing but baked
//! into the highlighted tree, and the diagram generation, since the options
//! carry only a `&dyn DiagramSource` with no comparable identity — are spelled
//! out as separate fields.
//!
//! # 2. The search query is not a layout input
//!
//! This is deliberate, not an oversight. Match highlighting is painted over
//! the cached tree on the drawing path ([`RenderTree::mark_search`]), so a
//! keystroke in the `/` prompt costs a viewport of painting, not a re-layout
//! of the document. The price is that painted state is *not* part of the key:
//! anything that changes the tree must call [`App::clear_painted`] so the
//! next frame repaints, which is why [`App::splice_section`] and
//! [`App::invalidate`] both do.
//!
//! # 3. Folding one section splices; everything else rebuilds
//!
//! A collapse or expand changes one contiguous run of top-level nodes, so
//! [`App::splice_section`] re-lays out just that run and leaves the rest of
//! the tree alone. It returns `false` — and the caller must then rebuild —
//! whenever the equivalence is not provable: no cached tree to splice into, a
//! section whose node range does not line up, or a range touching footnote
//! definitions, whose layout at the end of the document depends on fold state
//! outside the range. A spliced tree is required to be indistinguishable from
//! a rebuilt one; the tests in this file assert exactly that.
//!
//! Realization is lazy in the same spirit: only the visible lines plus
//! [`REALIZE_LOOKAHEAD`] on each side are syntax-highlighted and
//! search-painted, so opening a large document costs a screen, not a file.
//!
//! Scrolling, link cycling, TOC selection and help scrolling never reach any
//! of this.
