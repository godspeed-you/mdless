//! Shared test-support vocabulary for the crate's unit tests.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Almost every `#[cfg(test)]` block in `diple` needs the same three or four
//! values: a parsed [`Document`], a [`Theme`], a [`LayoutOptions`] and — in
//! `app` — a fully wired [`App`]. Spelled out by hand at every call site,
//! those literals are what makes the suite rot: adding a field to [`AppEnv`]
//! or [`AppOptions`] means editing every `App::new` literal, which is exactly
//! what happened when the key hints sidebar was added.
//!
//! # Why it is not a cargo feature
//!
//! It is declared as `#[cfg(test)] pub(crate) mod testing;` in `lib.rs`, so it
//! is compiled only when the library is built *as a test target*. A cargo
//! feature would be enableable by any downstream `--features` flag and would
//! ship these helpers in a release build; `cfg(test)` cannot be turned on from
//! outside. Verified with
//! `cargo build --release && nm -C target/release/diple | grep -i testing`,
//! which finds nothing.
//!
//! # Boundary
//!
//! Integration tests in `tests/` link the library as an *external* crate,
//! built without `cfg(test)`, so they cannot see this module. Their shared
//! helpers live in `tests/common/mod.rs`.
//!
//! # How to use it
//!
//! Reach for these helpers when a test needs a *plausible* value. A test that
//! is about an unusual [`Config`], an exotic capability set or a hand-built
//! [`RenderLine`](crate::render::primitives::RenderLine) should keep building
//! that value visibly at the call site — the point of the helper is to hide
//! the boilerplate, never the thing under test.

// A shared vocabulary is allowed to offer a word this particular test binary
// happens not to use; `dead_code` here would only push tests back to writing
// the literal out by hand.
