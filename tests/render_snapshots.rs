//! Golden snapshot tests: every fixture is laid out at 40, 80 and 120 columns
//! and compared against a committed plain-text snapshot.
//!
//! The plain-text serialisation is `RenderTree::to_plain_text`, which is also
//! what `--color never` output is built from.
//!
//! Two kinds of test live here, and the difference matters:
//!
//! * the **snapshots** pin the exact appearance of a fixture at a width;
//! * the **invariants** pin properties that must hold for every fixture at
//!   every width. A snapshot diff of 65 plain-text lines is a thing humans
//!   review badly and `cargo insta accept` makes it cheaper to say yes than
//!   to read — which is how literal `###` markers once got baked into
//!   accepted snapshots. An invariant fails with a pointer at the offending
//!   line instead.
